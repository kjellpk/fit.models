Title: Compare Fitted Models
Description: A collection of functions intended to aid package authors facilitate \
  model comparison. Presently the functions designMD, indexPlot.lmfm, kernDenPlot.lmfm, \
  overlaidKernDenPlot.lmfm, overlaidQQPlot.lmfm, qqPlot.lmfm, scatterPlot.lmfm, and \
  simpleRegPlot.lmfm comprise this collection. These functions are used to extend \
  R's common generic functions (e.g., print, summary, plot, etc.) to provide \
  side-by-side comparison of fitted model objects inheriting from class lm, and \
  (separately) fitted model objects inheriting from class glm. The API provided \
  by this package is not frozen and is highly likely to change until the package \
  reaches version 1.0.
