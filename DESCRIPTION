Title: Compare Fitted Models
Description: The fit.models function and its associated methods (coefficients,
  print, summary, plot, etc.) were originally provided in the robust package to
  compare robustly and classically fitted model objects. The aim of the fit.models
  package is to separate this fitted model object comparison functionality from
  the robust package and to extend it to support fitting methods (e.g., classical,
  robust, Bayesian, regularized, etc.) more generally.
